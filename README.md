Harmonization Finder

The code includes a Streamlit-based web app developed for analyzing text data using embeddings and similarity calculations. The app allows users to upload data, filter it, and identify relevant text pairs based on their similarity. This can speed up and facilitate the first step in data harmonization.

The application was conceived and provided in the context of the publication ()

script features integration with various Python libraries and APIs to perform data preprocessing and analysis tasks. Here's a brief description of its functionalities:

1. **Data Import and Environment Setup**: The script imports necessary libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `streamlit`, `matplotlib`, and others for data manipulation, visualization, and web app development. It also includes `openai` and `openpyxl` for AI-based text processing and Excel file handling.

2. **Streamlit Integration**: The use of `streamlit` suggests that the script is meant to run as a web application, allowing for interactive data input and visualization.

3. **Data Upload Functionality**: A function `get_data()` is implemented to upload data files (CSV, XLSX) through a Streamlit interface, enabling users to easily input their data sets for analysis.

4. **Sentence Embedding and Similarity Calculation**: The script employs `SentenceTransformer` from the `sentence_transformers` library to calculate embeddings of textual data, which are then used to compute cosine similarity scores. This is crucial for analyzing and comparing text-based data, such as questionnaire responses.

5. **Data Processing and Harmonization**: Functions like `get_similarity_dataframe()` and `calculate_embeddings()` suggest that the script processes the data to find similarities between different datasets, a key step in data harmonization.

6. **Interactive Data Selection and Filtering**: The script seems to provide an interactive interface for selecting and filtering data based on user inputs, potentially through Streamlit widgets.

7. **Exporting Data**: Functions are provided to convert data frames to CSV or Excel formats, allowing users to download the processed data.

8. **API Key Integration for OpenAI**: The script includes functionality for users to input their OpenAI API key, indicating the use of OpenAI's services, possibly for advanced text processing or analysis.

9. **Embedding and Similarity Tabs**: The script includes tabs for loading data, building embeddings, creating similarity pairs, and viewing these pairs, indicating a step-by-step process for users to follow in the web application.

Overall, this script seems ideal for researchers and data analysts looking to harmonize and analyze text-based data, especially from multiple sources or studies. The integration with machine learning models for text similarity and the user-friendly Streamlit interface makes it a powerful tool for complex data harmonization tasks.
